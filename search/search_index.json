I'm also a member of the Trottier Space Institute (TSI). I study transients - short-lived cosmic events. I'm interested in gravitational wave (GW) sources, notably neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) and black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) merger events, also known as kilonovae. These are believed to be the birthplace of the heaviest elements in the Universe.</p> <p>My thesis project revolves around one of these GW sources, GW170817 - a NS-NS merger event and the only one to have electromagnetic (EM) counterparts observed. With rich data, GW170817 may be the key to understanding rapid neutron capture (r-process). Using the Spectroscopic r-Process Abundance Retrieval for Kilonovae (SPARK), I will peer into the spectra of GW170817 unlike ever before, bringing us closer to uncovering the secrets of how the heaviest elements in the Universe are synthesized.</p>"},{"location":"about/#my-hobbies","title":"My Hobbies","text":"<p>On my personal time, I enjoy many hobbies, mainly cooking, reading, and taking care of my plants!</p> <ul> <li>Cooking</li> <li>Reading</li> <li>Plants</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/cooking/","title":"My Latest Meal","text":"<p>Made some curried wonton soup!
