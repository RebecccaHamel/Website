Welcome to my website! My name is Rebecca and I am a first-year physics master's student at McGill University. 

Fascinated by the extreme cosmic events that happen in our Universe, my research encompasses the study of transient events, mainly gravitational wave (GW) sources such as merging neutron stars or black holes. 

If you're like to learn more about me, you can find an introduction to [my research](./reasearch/research_index.md) and some more info [about me](./about/about.md).
