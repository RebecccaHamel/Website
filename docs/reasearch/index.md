# Research Interests

I'm interested in transient events - temporary short-lived astronomical events. I use multi-messenger astrophysics to understand these transients, notably neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) and black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) mergers, or kilonovae - gravitational wave (GW) sources with electromagnetic (EM) counterparts.

Kilonovae are thought to be the main mechanism in the synthesis of the heaviest elements in the Universe through rapid neutron capture (r-process). By studying the EM coutnerparts of these sources, we can uncover information on the chemical abundances produced in those events.

**Analysis of the Warm Absorber in NGC 6814**
Saint Mary’s University - 2023
Modeling the highly-ionised gas in the AGN NGC 6814 by analysing its high resolution spectra, and determining its charac-
teristics such as composition, temperature, density, location, and kinematics.

**Predicting the Performance of CASTOR for Kinematics in the Outskirts of Globular Clusters**
Saint Mary’s University - 2022
Using Cluster Monte Carlo simulations and the CASTOR exposure time calculator to determine CASTOR’s capacity to
constrain the proper motions of globular cluster members and detect the presence of dark matter halos.
