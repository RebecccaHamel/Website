# Research Interests

Gravitational-wave astronomy has opened a new window onto compact-object mergers and the astrophysical environments that produce the heaviest elements. When two neutron stars collide, they emit both gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation; the resulting kilonova carries the spectral signatures of rapid neutron-capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis.

My research focuses on analysing the kilonova associated with the first detected neutron star merger, **GW170817**, using **SPARK (Spectral r-Process Abundance Retrieval for Kilonovae)**. SPARK is a machine-learning framework that integrates radiative-transfer modelling, Gaussian-process surrogate modelling, and Bayesian inference to extract chemical-abundance information from kilonova spectra. Recent advances in theoretical and experimental atomic line lists provide new opportunities to identify additional elements in the spectrum of GW170817.

My master’s thesis aims to produce the most detailed elemental analysis of GW170817 to date by incorporating updated line lists and improved statistical modelling. This work will help refine our understanding of how neutron star mergers contribute to the cosmic inventory of heavy elements and the atomic processes shaping kilonova emission.

# Prior Research

**Analysis of the Warm Absorber in NGC 6814**  
Saint Mary’s University — 2023

For my Honours thesis, I analysed high-resolution X-ray spectra of the Seyfert galaxy **NGC 6814** to characterise its warm absorber. Using photoionisation modelling, I constrained the absorber’s composition, temperature, density, velocity structure, and physical location within the AGN environment.

**Predicting the Performance of CASTOR for Kinematics in the Outskirts of Globular Clusters**  
Saint Mary’s University — 2022

In this project, I used Cluster Monte Carlo simulations and the CASTOR exposure-time calculator to evaluate the telescope’s ability to measure proper motions in globular clusters. My analysis assessed CASTOR’s capacity to detect potential dark-matter signatures in cluster outskirts and contributed to the mission’s science-case development.
