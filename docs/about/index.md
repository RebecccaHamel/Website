# Introduction

My name is Rebecca and I'm a first year master's student in Physics and Astronomy at McGill University! I am also a member of the Trottier Space Institute. I currently study transient events - short-lived cosmic events. I specifically am interested gravitational wave (GW) sources, notably neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) and black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) merger events, also known as kilonovae - believed to be the birthplace of the heaviest elements in the Universe.

My thesis project revolves around one of these GW sources, GW170817 - a NS-NS merger event, and the only one to have electromagnetic (EM) counterparts observed. With rich data, GW170817 may be the key to understanding rapid neutron capture (r-process). Using the Spectroscopic r-Process Abundance Retrieval for Kilonovae (SPARK), I will peer into the spectra of GW170817 unlike ever before, bringing us closer to uncovering the secrets of how the heaviest elements in the Universe are synthesized.
