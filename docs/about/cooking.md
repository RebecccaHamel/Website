# Lockdown Hobbies

My passion for cooking started the way it began for many - during the pandemic, when there was not much else to do! First, it was baking, with some of my most notable desserts being a classic tiramisu and a decadent 3-layer black forest cake, but my horizons soon grew as I began to explore the world of cooking.

My favourite cuisines to make are Italian and Japanese - I make a mean carbonara (if I do say so myself). I hope to continue sharpening my culinary skills and who knows, maybe some day I'll be known as the Astronomy Chef!
