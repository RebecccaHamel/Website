# Blogging Plans

I've been considering turning this page into a reading blog! I love to read, but sometime find it hard to be motivated to read - I think a blog might be the perfect motivation to be consistent!

# My Current Reads

I've recently been reading lots of fantasy novels and have taken on the burden of reading one of the most famous fantasy series of all time: The Lord of the Rings...

Sometimes when the world of astronomy becomes too vast and complex, escaping to the burrows of the Shire is the perfect remedy after a hard day's work.

Having already watched the movies (multiple times a year), I've found a new appreciation for the world of Tolkien. I feel transported into his world through his words, and it has been a new found comfort (unlike certain prequel series published by Amazon...)

Here's also a beautiful vintage copy of the hobbit:

It's from 1977, and is in beautiful condition!I love the colourscheme, and Smaug looks so cute and cozy on his treasure pile. Oh to be a dragon sleeping in all the time...
