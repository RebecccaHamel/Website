# My Green Thumb

In my opinion, plants are the best type of medicine - especially in Montreal! Surrounding myself with greenery helps me relax, claim my space, and pour my time and effort into making something grow and flourish!

Here's a few plants I saved from the side of the road: The two plants on the left are heartleaf philohendrons (philohendron hederaceum) and a Adanson's monstera (monstera adansonii)
